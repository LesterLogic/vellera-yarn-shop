# Vellera Yarns - A Web Project by Jon Lester

Vellera Yarns is a coding project I am working on to demonstrate and improve my skills using React, Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind.

I am not a designer by trade, so please be kind regarding the aesthetics.

The logo is an original(-ish) design of my own creation. Most photographic images were generated using Bing AI. Product images are the property of their respective owners, but whose products I wholeheartedly endorse as an enthusiast knitter.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running Tests

This project uses Playwright for e2e and integration testing.

Run the tests from the command line:
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
